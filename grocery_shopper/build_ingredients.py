    Builds the ingredient list of a recipe by parsing the yaml file and adding
    the information from the corresponding CSV files, namely `category` and `url`.

    The function will return two lists, the first holding `Ingredient`s with valid `category` and `url` attributes, the latter with predefined ones.
    This necessary to ask the user for completing the data.

    I know, there are other methods to store objects but Text (in comparison to binary) gives the user the opportunity to edit the data.
    Additionally, this surely becomes necessary because nobody can guarantee that an URL will stay valid. The vendor might change it.
